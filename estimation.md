1\. Story Point Estimation Techniques



Story points are a way to measure how much effort a task (user story) will take, considering:



How complex it is



How much work it involves



How risky or uncertain it feels



Common Techniques



Planning Poker



Team members pick a card representing their estimate (like 1, 2, 3, 5, 8…).



Everyone shows their card at the same time.



Differences spark discussion until the team agrees.



Why it works: Gets everyone’s opinion and reduces bias.



T-Shirt Sizing



Stories are labeled XS, S, M, L, XL based on effort.



Simple, visual, and easy for big-picture planning.



Later, these sizes can be converted into story points.



Bucket or Affinity Estimation



Quickly sort stories into groups like “easy, medium, hard” or buckets (1, 2, 3, 5…).



Fast for large backlogs but less precise per story.



2\. Weighting User Stories



Once stories are estimated, you can decide which to do first by weighing them with three factors:



Complexity: How hard or risky it is.



Priority: How urgent or important the story is to the business.



Business Value: How much impact it will have (customer happiness, revenue, strategic goals).



Example

Story	Complexity (1–5)	Priority (1–5)	Business Value (1–5)	Weighted Score

Login Feature	2	5	5	4.0

Reporting Module	4	4	4	4.0

Chatbot Integration	5	3	3	3.7



Formula: Weighted Score = (Complexity + Priority + Value) ÷ 3



Higher scores → do these first (high value and priority, manageable effort).



3\. Key Takeaways



Story points = relative measure of effort, not hours.



Planning Poker \& T-Shirt Sizing make estimation collaborative and intuitive.



Weighting stories ensures the team focuses on the most valuable, important, and achievable tasks first.
