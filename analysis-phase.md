Analysis Phase in the SDLC



The analysis phase is the stage in software development where the project team investigates what the system needs to do. It’s about understanding business goals, user needs, and system requirements before design and coding begin.



Why it’s important:



Prevents costly mistakes by clarifying requirements early.



Aligns the development team and stakeholders.



Forms the foundation for design, coding, and testing.



Reduces risks from misunderstandings or missing requirements.



ps in the Analysis Phase

1\. Requirement Gathering



Goal: Collect information about what users and stakeholders need.



How: Interviews, surveys, workshops, observing current systems.



Outcome: A list of initial requirements.



2\. Requirement Analysis



Goal: Examine and refine requirements.



How: Identify gaps, conflicts, and feasibility. Categorize into functional (features) and non-functional (performance, security, usability) requirements.



Outcome: Clear and realistic requirements.



3\. Requirement Specification



Goal: Document requirements formally.



How: Create a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) with text, diagrams (like use-case diagrams or flowcharts), and constraints.



Outcome: A formal document that guides development.



4\. Requirement Validation



Goal: Ensure requirements are correct and complete.



How: Review and get stakeholder approval, possibly with prototypes or mock-ups.



Outcome: Verified and approved requirements ready for the design phase.

Deliverables



SRS Document: Detailed functional and non-functional requirements.



Use-case diagrams / Flowcharts: Visual representation of system behavior.



Feasibility report: Assessment of technical, financial, and operational feasibility.



Requirement traceability matrix (optional): Links requirements to design and tests.



Approved requirement baseline: Reference for future phases.

Best Practices



Keep communication open with stakeholders.



Use clear, unambiguous language.



Validate requirements with users.



Prioritize critical features.



Maintain proper documentation and version control.

ommon Challenges



Ambiguous or incomplete requirements.



Frequent changes in business needs.



Miscommunication between stakeholders and developers.



Scope creep (adding features without proper analysis).



Time constraints limiting thorough analysis.
